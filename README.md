# Project Description
The goal of this project is to show relevant statistics of a text file similar to the Word Count box from 
Microsoft Word and the Notepad++ summary (at the bottom of the application).

This project will also search and display the top 10 most frequently occuring word from the file. For more details, please open the Jupyter notebook file, Text Statistics.ipynb.
